  - title: Reporting a Vulnerability
    content: 'If a security vulnerability is identified in dependency-check please

      open an [issue](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/new/choose)

      and/or submit a PR to resolve the identified vulnerability.


      The team is very responsive to reported vulnerabilities - historically having
      reported issues resolved in 30 days or less.


      Note - there are several vulnerable test dependencies and test resources. These
      are never executed or included in a release; these vulnerable resources are
      present so that the functionality of dependency-check can be tested (i.e. it
      correctly identifies the given vulnerable test dependency).'
